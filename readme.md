# Welcome to the Uniswap Arbitrage Bot Documentation

This documentation provides information on how to use the Uniswap Arbitrage Bot, a tool for identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

## Overview
The Uniswap Arbitrage Bot is a Node.js application that uses the Uniswap v3 smart contracts to identify price discrepancies between tokens on the Uniswap exchange. The bot can be configured with a list of token pairs to monitor, and will automatically search for cycles in the token pairs where an arbitrage opportunity exists.

Once an arbitrage opportunity is found, the bot will execute a series of trades on the Uniswap exchange to profit from the price discrepancy. The bot will then transfer the profits to a designated Ethereum wallet.

## Getting Started
To use the Uniswap Arbitrage Bot, you will need to have the following:

* Node.js installed on your system
* An Ethereum wallet with an associated private key
* A configuration file containing the addresses of the Uniswap v2 smart contracts and your Ethereum wallet information

Once you have the required components, you can download the bot from the Github repository and install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
To run the bot, simply navigate to the bot directory in your terminal and run the following command:

~~~
node index.js
~~~

The bot will then begin searching for arbitrage opportunities based on the token pairs specified in the pairs.json file. When an opportunity is found, the bot will print the details to the console and execute the necessary trades on the Uniswap exchange.

## Configuration
The Uniswap Arbitrage Bot can be configured by editing the config.json file. This file contains the following fields:

* rpcUrl: The URL of the Ethereum JSON-RPC API.
* privateKey: The private key associated with your Ethereum wallet.
* uniswapFactoryAddress: The address of the Uniswap v2 factory contract.
* uniswapRouterAddress: The address of the Uniswap v2 router contract.
* uniswapPairABI: The ABI for the Uniswap v2 pair contract.

You can also edit the pairs.json file to specify which token pairs the bot should monitor for arbitrage opportunities.

## Conclusion
The Uniswap Arbitrage Bot is a powerful tool for identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities on the Uniswap decentralized exchange. By using this bot, you can take advantage of price discrepancies between tokens to generate profits on the Ethereum blockchain.
